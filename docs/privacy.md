### 4.2 Ad display

We may show ads to users in certain regions. The ads we display on our services are provided either by advertisers with whom we have a relationship, or by third-party advertising networks such as Google. To display third-party ads in our application, we integrate a software development kit (SDK) into them, which consists of program code provided by the advertising network.

We provide limited personal data about you to such third-party advertising networks so that they can provide their services. For example, some of these advertising networks may collect information through their SDKs, such as your mobile ad ID, IP address, and device information, in order to show you “personalized” ads (ads that they think are more relevant to you) and measure your reaction to these ads. If you use a VPN connection, your IP address is hidden from advertising networks and replaced with the IP address of our VPN servers.

Each advertising network collects this information in accordance with its privacy policy. When an ad logo appears in the ad, you can click on it to learn more about the advertising network that provided the ad, its privacy policy and your choice to opt out of any personalized advertising. If you opt out of personalized ads, you will still be able to see non-personalized ads.

Although we ask you not to use ad blockers to prevent third-party ads from being served, since this is how we support our free services, our services will be able to continue functioning if you do use them.
