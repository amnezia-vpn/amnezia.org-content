# Security Capabilities & Policy for Transmission of Payment

**2024/04/02**

## What information do we collect and how do we use it?

When you place an order through this website, we need to know your name, e-mail, phone number, address and credit card 
details if paying by credit card. This allows us to process and fulfil your order successfully.

## How do we protect customer information?

When you place orders, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before 
it is sent to us. Furthermore, all the sensitive customer data we collect is protected by several layers of encryption 
and several layers of security to prevent unauthorised access.

## Credit card details

All credit card payments are processed securely through the Stripe payment gateway. Amnezia.cloud does not store any credit card information on our servers.

## Payment gateway info

Our payment options are safe and secure. None of your payment details are stored â€“ this ensures you will be happy with the security of your transaction.
