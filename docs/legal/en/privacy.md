# Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy
**Effective Date: 14.10.2025**

At Amnezia, we prioritize the privacy and security of your data above all else. We strive to collect the minimum amount of personal data and remain transparent about what data we collect and why. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information, and it complies with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. What We Offer and How It Works
Amnezia provides functionality for creating a VPN on your own server, as well as ready-made VPN services available in the AmneziaVPN application.

### 1.1 Self-Hosted VPN Setup
A user can set up their own VPN server by entering server access details (IP, login, password/key) into the AmneziaVPN client. We do not collect, store, or transmit these details—they remain only on the user’s device.

### 1.2 Amnezia Free
A user can obtain a VPN configuration (key) in two ways:
- Via the Telegram bot – when using the bot, we only collect the user’s Telegram ID for identification;
- Via the AmneziaVPN application.

When connecting to AmneziaFree, we collect:
- The application version and operating system (for internal statistics);
- A device ID (to link keys to the device and enable their recovery);

When connecting to AmneziaFree, we also process IP addresses. This is necessary solely to determine the regions where blocking occurs and to ensure correct server operation. The IP is not stored or used for identification.

If a user engages in actions that harm the service (for example, spam, DDoS), Amnezia may temporarily store the IP address to prevent abuse and protect the infrastructure.

### 1.3 Amnezia Premium
When purchasing a subscription through [https://pay.amnezia.org](https://pay.amnezia.org), we collect only the user's email address. The user's IP address may be transmitted to the payment gateway by the [https://pay.amnezia.org](https://pay.amnezia.org) site when necessary, but it is not stored. 
After connecting to Amnezia Premium through the application, we collect:
- The application version and operating system (for internal analytics);
- A device ID (to link keys to the device);

Users' IP addresses are not collected or stored. The exception is temporary logging in cases of violations that harm the service, using servers for spam distribution, DDoS attacks, or traffic abuse.

### 1.4 Amnezia Affiliate (Partner and Referral Program)
Under our affiliate program, we collect:
- An email (user identifier);
- A cryptocurrency wallet (for commission payouts);

### 1.5 Websites (amnezia.org, docs.amnezia.org)
On the amnezia.org website, we use:
- Language cookies;
- Anonymized statistical data (visits, referral sources, downloads, user regions, and devices);

These data are collected via self-hosted Plausible and Cloudflare Insights. The data are anonymized and cannot be used to identify the user.
When submitting the form at [https://amnezia.org/business](https://amnezia.org/business), we collect:
- Email;
- Company name;
- Number of employees;

These data are processed through the Web3Forms service. For more details, see their privacy policy.
On the docs.amnezia.org website, only a cookie for the interface language is used.
