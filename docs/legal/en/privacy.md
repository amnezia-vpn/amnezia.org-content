# Privacy Policy
**Effective Date: 31.03.2025**

At Amnezia, we prioritize the privacy and security of your data above all else. We strive to collect the minimum amount of personal data and remain transparent about what data we collect and why. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information, and it complies with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. What We Offer and How It Works
Amnezia provides functionality for creating a VPN on your own server, as well as ready-made VPN services available in the AmneziaVPN application.

### 1.1 Self-Hosted VPN Setup
A user can set up their own VPN server by entering server access details (IP, login, password/key) into the AmneziaVPN client. We do not collect, store, or transmit these details—they remain only on the user’s device.

### 1.2 Amnezia Free
A user can obtain a VPN configuration (key) in two ways:
- Via the Telegram bot – when using the bot, we only collect the user’s Telegram ID for identification;
- Via the AmneziaVPN application.

When connecting to AmneziaFree, we collect:
- The application version and operating system (for internal statistics);
- A device ID (to link keys to the device and enable their recovery);

When connecting to AmneziaFree, we also process IP addresses. This is necessary solely to determine the regions where blocking occurs and to ensure correct server operation. The IP is not stored or used for identification.

If a user engages in actions that harm the service (for example, spam, DDoS), Amnezia may temporarily store the IP address to prevent abuse and protect the infrastructure.

### 1.3 Amnezia Premium
When purchasing a subscription through VPN Pay, we collect only the user’s email address. VPN Pay may pass on the user’s IP address to the payment gateway if the gateway requires it, but the IP is not stored.
After connecting to Amnezia Premium through the application, we collect:
- The application version and operating system (for internal analytics);
- A device ID (to link keys to the device);

Users’ IP addresses are not collected or stored. The only exception is temporary logging in the event of violations that harm the service, such as using servers for spam, DDoS attacks, or traffic abuse.

### 1.4 Amnezia Affiliate (Partner and Referral Program)
Under our affiliate program, we collect:
- An email (user identifier);
- A cryptocurrency wallet (for commission payouts);

### 1.5 Websites (amnezia.org, docs.amnezia.org)
On the amnezia.org website, we use:
- Language cookies;
- Anonymized statistical data (visits, referral sources, downloads, user regions, and devices);

These data are collected via self-hosted Plausible and Cloudflare Insights. The data are anonymized and cannot be used to identify the user.
When submitting the form at [https://amnezia.org/business](https://amnezia.org/business), we collect:
- Email;
- Company name;
- Number of employees;

These data are processed through the Web3Forms service. For more details, see their privacy policy.
On the docs.amnezia.org website, only a cookie for the interface language is used.

## 2. What Data We Collect and Why

### 2.1 Data Provided by the User
- Email – for communication, subscription, or affiliate payouts;
- Company name and number of employees – when filling out the business form;
- Cryptocurrency wallet – for affiliate payouts;

### 2.2 Data Collected Automatically
- Telegram ID – for issuing AmneziaFree configurations;
- Device ID and operating system – for key functionality and internal statistics;
- Application version – for compatibility and improvements;
- IP address – processed temporarily:
  - For analyzing blockages (AmneziaFree);
  - For preventing violations (in cases of abuse and for protecting Amnezia’s infrastructure and services);

### 2.3 What Data We Do Not Collect
We do not collect or store information about VPN usage (traffic, visited websites, etc.).
We do not receive data from third-party authorizations (Google and others) as we do not use such login methods.

## 3. How We Use Data
We use data solely for:
- Providing access to our services;
- Maintaining and improving service stability;
- Communicating with users at their request;
- Processing payments and payouts;
- Preventing abuse and attacks;
- Analyzing anonymized statistics to improve the product;

VPN traffic and activity are not used for analytics or advertising.

## 4. Transfer of Data to Third Parties
We do not transfer your data to third parties, except in the following cases:
- Data from the business form on [https://amnezia.org/business](https://amnezia.org/business) are transferred to the Web3Forms service (see their privacy policy);
- VPN Pay may transfer data to payment gateways (see the payment gateways’ policies);

No other data are transferred to third parties.

## 5. Cookies and Analytics
We use cookies only for the proper functioning of the websites:
- Language settings (cookies);
- Anonymized analytics via Plausible (self-hosted) and Cloudflare Insights;

Only aggregated statistical data are collected. We do not track users’ personal activities.
You can disable cookies in your browser settings—this will not affect access to the functionality.

## 6. Security
We employ modern technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or loss of data. Regular checks and audits ensure a high level of security.

## 7. International Data Transfer
Sometimes data may be transferred outside the EEA. In such cases, we:
- Use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) approved by the European Commission;
- Employ data minimization, encryption, and anonymization;

You can contact us for more details.

## 8. Data Retention
