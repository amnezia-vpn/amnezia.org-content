## 1. Introduction
This is the Amnezia Hosting (“we”, “us”, or “our”) Privacy Policy.  
It describes how we collect, use, store, and disclose information obtained from our customers and visitors to our websites (“Users”).  
We process personal data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws.

When registering an account and using our services, the User provides:
- First name;

We do **not** collect or store any other personal data: we do not use cookies for tracking, do not maintain personalized logs, and do not retain IP addresses for the purpose of user identification.

## 3. Purpose of Processing
We process personal data solely for:
- fulfilling the contract and providing hosting services;
- complying with legal and accounting obligations;
- protecting our legitimate interests (e.g., preventing abuse or violations of our Terms of Service).

Processing is based on the necessity to perform a contract, legitimate interests, or, where required, the User’s consent.

## 4. Data Disclosure to Third Parties
Personal data may be disclosed to third parties (such as payment processors or technical service providers) **only** to the extent necessary to fulfill our obligations.  
We require such parties to maintain confidentiality and ensure data protection in accordance with applicable laws.  
Transfers of data outside the EU, if any, are carried out in full compliance with the GDPR.

## 5. Data Retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Policy or for as long as required by law.  
After that, the data is deleted or anonymized.

Users have the right to:
- access their personal data;
- request correction or deletion of data;
- restrict data processing;
- object to data processing;
- withdraw consent (if applicable);
- file a complaint with a supervisory authority.

Requests can be sent to **abuse@amnezia.host**.

## 7. Data Security
We implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction, including encryption, access control, and regular security audits.  
In the event of a security incident, we act in accordance with applicable law and, where necessary, notify Users and supervisory authorities.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
Services are provided “as is” and “as available.”  
We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, error-free performance, or absence of data loss.  
We are not liable for indirect damages, loss of profit, or other consequences arising from the use or inability to use our services, unless otherwise required by law.  
These limitations do not apply where liability cannot be excluded by law (e.g., in cases of intent or gross negligence).

## 9. Content and Third-Party Resources
Amnezia Hosting is not responsible for materials posted or transmitted by users or third parties through our services.  
We do not conduct constant monitoring and do not control such content, but we may take action where required or permitted by law.  
Amnezia Hosting is also not responsible for the content of third-party websites that may be linked from our resources. Links are provided solely for user convenience.

## 10. Acceptable Use

- illegal activities;
- sending spam, phishing, or fraudulent messages;

In case of a violation, we reserve the right, without prior notice, to suspend or terminate services, remove materials, block accounts, or take other necessary actions.
