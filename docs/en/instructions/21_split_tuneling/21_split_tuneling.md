If you select "Split Site Tunneling", you will see a menu with a line in front of you.\
You will be able to enter site addresses or site IPs and create two lists of sites. \
- One list is for sites that you want to open with VPN, all other sites will be opened without VPN.
- The second one is for exclusion sites.  With VPN will open all sites except sites from the list.
If you click on the "three dots" in the bottom right corner, you will be able to download the list of sites from your device, or save the list of files.
