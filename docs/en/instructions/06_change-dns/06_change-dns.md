# Changing DNS server

### Why might you need to change your DNS?

In some cases, ISPs or governments may block access to certain websites or services through their DNS.
Changing your DNS server can help you bypass such blockages and access restricted content.

In addition, some DNS servers may collect data about your online activity, such as websites you visit and
DNS queries. Switching to your own DNS server, helps protect your personal information.
