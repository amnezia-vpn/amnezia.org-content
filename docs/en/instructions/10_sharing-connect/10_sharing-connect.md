# Share the connection

Share a connection means to give access to your VPN to another user. 
You can give full access, with the ability to make changes on the server.  
In this case, the person you share it with will be able to install and configure protocols and other Amnezia services.
Or you can grant access for connection only. In this case, the user you shared it with will be able to use your VPN.
use your VPN, but will not be able to change its settings and protocols.

> If the user you shared full access to the server with deletes the protocol, or reinstalls it, 
you will not be able to connect to it until you reinstall it. Therefore, we recommend sharing full access only with your own devices.
