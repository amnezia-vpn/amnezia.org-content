# Connection access only

In case you have shared a connection without the ability to customize the server, some elements of the interface will not be available to you.

&nbsp;

### Description of settings when access is restricted

In the server settings section, the Protocols tab will only show the protocols that have been shared with you, with no option to add more.

In the settings section, in the "Services" tab, you will only be able to change DNS. 
Other services, such as the ability to deploy a site in the Tor network, or create a file storage, are only possible with full access to the server.
