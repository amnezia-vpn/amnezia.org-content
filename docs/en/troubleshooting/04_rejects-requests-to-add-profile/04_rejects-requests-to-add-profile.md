# Android rejects requests to add VPN profile.

If other VPN applications are installed on your device alongside Amnezia, the issue may arise due to additional options enabled on Android, causing requests to add other profiles to be rejected by default.

> **Solution**
>
> In the system settings, locate "VPN," where profiles of programs are listed.
> Disable additional options:
> "Always-on VPN" or "Block connections without VPN."
